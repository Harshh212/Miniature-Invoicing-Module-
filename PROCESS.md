Development Journey: Miniature Invoicing ModuleThis document outlines the step-by-step process I followed to build the Miniature Invoicing Module on the Frappe Framework.Phase 1: Server and Environment SetupThis was the foundational and most challenging part of the project. I chose to use a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) free tier server running Ubuntu 22.04 to simulate a real-world deployment.Problem 1: Out of Memory Errors (SIGKILL: 9): The server's default RAM was insufficient for the installation process.Solution: I created a 2GB swap file to provide additional virtual memory, which allowed the installation to complete successfully.Problem 2: Out of Disk Space: The default hard drive size (8 GB) was too small for the Frappe and ERPNext installations.Solution: I resized the server's hard drive to 30 GB to provide enough storage space.Problem 3: Missing Dependencies: The honcho and nano commands were missing, and the pip environment was not correctly configured.Solution: I manually installed the necessary packages and configured the Python virtual environment to ensure all Frappe dependencies were met.Phase 2: Application Core DevelopmentWith the server running, I focused on building the core of the application using Frappe's tools.Data Modeling: I used Frappe's DocType system to define the application's data structure.Customer: A master DocType to store client information.Invoice Item: A child DocType for individual line items.Invoice: The main transactional DocType that links to a customer and contains a table of line items.Backend Business Logic: To automate the calculations, I implemented a Python function that runs on the server.I used the validate hook, a key Frappe feature, to ensure the calculation runs just before an invoice is saved.The function iterates through each Invoice Item to calculate its amount and then sums these values to compute the grand_total.Phase 3: User Interface and ShowcaseThe final phase involved making the application presentable and showcasing my understanding of the Frappe platform.Dashboard: I built a custom dashboard with number cards and a donut chart to provide a quick, visual overview of key metrics.Permissions: I configured a custom role (Invoice Viewer) to demonstrate Frappe's powerful role-based permissions system, limiting a user to only read invoices.Website: I created a public-facing website page using Frappe's built-in HTML editor, showcasing my ability
